         <p class= "wnt">For my project i want to create an app that shows the locations of the Universities on a map no matter where you are. I want to make this app because I want it to help high school kids be able to browse the colleges in the different places with the touch of a button. It will have a search bar that will help people find the name of a college that has similarites in the name of the college.</p>
         <p class= "wnt">I only thought of this idea because in a few years I'll have to choose a college that I want to go to, and it's challenging to pick one because the colleges that I may want to go to might not be within the city or state I live in and I might want to go to a college that is closer to me.</p>
