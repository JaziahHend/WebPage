            <p class= "abt">I am a rising Junior attending Gateway High School. I played a wide variety of sports from 2nd Grade to Eighth Grade. I like to read, play games, and hang out with friends in my spare time.</p>

            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Things I Used To Do</h1>
            <p class="th"> From around the time I was a baby to a few years ago, my family and I used to travel outside of the country and explore some of the best, coolest, and old places around the world. I love to travel and explore new places and see what kind of things other cultures have to offer.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1  style="text-align: center;">Sports</h1>
            <p class= "spts">Some of the sports I used to play were: Soccer, Football, Baseball, and Wrestling. I loved playing all of these sports going through middle school but eventually lost interest in them once i entered high school.</p>
            <hr>
            <h1 style="text-align: center;">Books</h1>
            <p class= "bk">As I said before, I like to read books in my spare time. I generally like to read books with fantasy, action, and adventure in them. Rick Riordan, author of the Percy Jackson Series, is my favorite author. His books are very interesting and I reccomend them to anyone with a large imagination because some of the scenes are very hard to imagine.</p>
